\subsection{Two-strains Tuberculosis Model.}
Seeking to reduce the latent and infectious groups with the 
resistant-strain tuberculosis, in \cite{Lenhart2002} the authors  use 
control theory to describe optimal strategies in a tuberculosis model 
which consider the effect of treatment in two kinds of strains. The 
controlled version reads:
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:MDR-TB_model}
	  \begin{aligned}
	    \frac{dS}{dt} &=
		    \Lambda - \beta_1 S \frac{I_1}{N} 
		    - \beta_3 S \frac{I_2}{N}
		    \mu S
		  \\
		  \frac{L_1}{dt} &=
			  \beta_1 S \frac{I_1}{N}
			  - (\mu + k_1) L_1
			  - u_1 (t) r_1 L_1
			  + (1 - u_2 (t)) p r_2 I_1
				+ \beta_2 T \frac{I_1}{N}
				- \beta_3 L_1 \frac{I_2}{N}
			\\
			\frac{I_1}{dt} &= 
				k_1 L_1
				- (\mu + d_1) I_1
				-r_2 I_1
			\\
			\frac{L_2}{dt} &=
				(1 - u_2(t)) q r_2 I_1
				- (\mu + k_2) L_2
				+ \beta_3 (S + L_1 + T) \frac{I_2}{N}
			\\
			\frac{I_2}{dt} &=
				k_2 L_2 - (\mu + d_2) I_2
			\\
			\frac{d T}{dt} &=
				u_1(t) r_1 L_1
				+ (1 - (1 - u_2(t))(p + q)) r_2 I_1
				- \beta T \frac{I_1}{N}
				- \beta_3 T \frac{I_2}{N}
				-\mu T.
	  \end{aligned}
	\end{equation}

	\citeauthor*{Lenhart2002} consider time dependent 
optimal control strategies associated with \emph{case holding} and 
\emph{case finding}. They incorporates the case finding control by adding a 
term which identifies and  cure a fraction o latent individuals. Case finding
consequently reduces the rate of disease development by latent individuals. The
authors includes case holding by adding a term which may decrease the treatment
failure rate of individuals with sensitive  TB, so, this control reduce the
incidence of drug resistant TB. In model \eqref{eqn:MDR-TB_model}, $u_1$ denotes
the fraction of typical TB latent individuals that is identified and will put
under treatment \textemdash case finding control \textemdash and $1 - u_2$
represents the effort that prevents the failure treatment in typical TB
infectious individuals.

	The controls $u_1$ ,$u_2$ reduce the latent and infected 
groups with resistant TB. However, the case holding and the case finding 
strategies produces a economic fee. In \cite{Lenhart2002} the authors use
\begin{equation}
	 J(u_1, u_2) =
		 \int_0 ^ {t_f}
			 \left[
				 L_2(t) + I_2(t) 
				 + \frac{B_1}{2} [u_1(t)] ^ 2
				 + \frac{B_2}{2} [u_2(t)] ^ 2
			 \right]dt,
\end{equation}
to describe the regarding cost.

parameters description and values used to produce this figure and fix 
$N = \num{30000}$, $\beta_3 = \num{0.29}$. To minimize the resistant TB 
population, L2 + I2, the simulation suggest that the case holding strategy 
$u_2$ would be at the upper bound during almost \num{4.3} years and then 
decreasing to the lower bound. Meanwhile, decreasing value for case finding
must apply over the most of the simulated time, 5 years. The total number of 
infected resistant TB $L2 + I2$  at the final time $t_f = 5(years)$ results
\num{1123}. This same number but without control sums 4176. So this policies 
prevents  \num{3053} (= 4176 âˆ’ 1123) cases of resistant TB.

According with \Cref{tbl:parameters_MDR-TB_model} and taking different values
for the parameter $\beta_3$, in \Cref{fig:figure2twostraintbm} we illustrate 
the effect of parameter $\beta_3$ over controls.The 
simulation suggest that both controls experiment small variations just at the 
beginning and reach almoss the same level after \SI{5}{year}.

\Cref{fig:figure3twostraintbm} illustrates case finding and case holding 
strategies under population of different sizes. The simulation suggest that
under relative small population, is more important holds case finding at the 
top. While for relatively bigger population the case holding is the more 
important strategy.
