\subsection*{Two-strains Tuberculosis}
Seeking to reduce the latent and infectious groups with the 
resistant-strain tuberculosis, in \cite{Lenhart2002} the authors  use 
control theory to describe optimal strategies in a tuberculosis model 
which considers the effect of treatment in two kinds of strains. The 
controlled version reads:
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:MDR-TB_model}
	  \begin{aligned}
	    \frac{dS}{dt} &=
		    \Lambda - \beta_1 S \frac{I_1}{N} 
		    - \beta_3 S \frac{I_2}{N}
		    \mu S,
		  \\
		  \frac{L_1}{dt} &=
			  \beta_1 S \frac{I_1}{N}
			  - (\mu + k_1) L_1
			  - u_1 (t) r_1 L_1
			  + (1 - u_2 (t)) p r_2 I_1
				+ \beta_2 T \frac{I_1}{N}
				- \beta_3 L_1 \frac{I_2}{N},
			\\
			\frac{I_1}{dt} &= 
				k_1 L_1
				- (\mu + d_1) I_1
				-r_2 I_1,
			\\
			\frac{L_2}{dt} &=
				(1 - u_2(t)) q r_2 I_1
				- (\mu + k_2) L_2
				+ \beta_3 (S + L_1 + T) \frac{I_2}{N},
			\\
			\frac{I_2}{dt} &=
				k_2 L_2 - (\mu + d_2) I_2,
			\\
			\frac{d T}{dt} &=
				u_1(t) r_1 L_1
				+ (1 - (1 - u_2(t))(p + q)) r_2 I_1
				- \beta T \frac{I_1}{N}
				- \beta_3 T \frac{I_2}{N}
				-\mu T.
	  \end{aligned}
	\end{equation}

     Lenhart, Jung, and Feng  \cite{Lenhart2002} consider time dependent 
optimal control strategies associated with \emph{case holding} and 
\emph{case finding}. They incorporate the case finding control by 
adding a term which identifies and  cure a fraction 
of latent individuals. Case finding consequently reduces the 
rate of disease development by latent individuals. The authors include 
case holding by adding a term which may decrease the 
treatment failure rate of individuals with sensitive  TB, so, this 
control reduce the incidence of drug resistant TB. In model 
\eqref{eqn:MDR-TB_model}, $u_1$ denotes the fraction of typical TB 
latent individuals that are identified  and put under treatment 
\textemdash case finding control\textemdash and 
$1 - u_2$ represents the effort that prevents the failure treatment in 
typical TB infectious individuals.

	The controls $u_1$ ,$u_2$ reduce the latent and infected 
groups with resistant TB. However, the case holding and the case finding 
strategies produce a cost modeled as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:MDR-TB_action}
		 \int_0 ^ {t_f}
			 \left[
				 L_2(t) + I_2(t) 
				 + \frac{B_1}{2} [u_1(t)] ^ 2
				 + \frac{B_2}{2} [u_2(t)] ^ 2
			 \right]dt.
\end{equation}
