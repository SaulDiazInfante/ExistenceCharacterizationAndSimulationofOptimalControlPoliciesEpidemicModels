\paragraph{Introduction.} 
Here we presented several control models that under our criteria are good 
examples. Before talking about this good examples, we give the core of optimal 
policy modeling.

First, we require a model to describe the spreading of an uncontrolled disease,
and whose transitions generate a cost. Then, we add a continuous control action
to modify the changes from one state to another but such that we optimize the
mentioned cost. A rule which prescribes which control operation to use at each
time is a control policy. A control policy which applies only information from
the current state of the controlled system to prescribe control actions is a
closed-loop or feedback control. If the current state is not observable, or the
control function only depends on the time we have an open-loop policy: the sort
of policies that we consider in this work.

Here, we consider control policies that affect the bounded rates at which
population moves from one class (e.g., infected) to another (e.g., recovered).
In all these problems, the control function appears linearly in the relevant
dynamic. Next, we specify a cost functional which assigns the total cost of the
control policy implementation. Then the problem is to determine a policy that
optimizes the regarding cost strategy.
