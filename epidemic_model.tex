  Here we consider a standard epidemic model to describe the dynamics of a 
disease. We use optimal control techniques to find a vaccination
schedule for the disease. Goal is to minimize the number of infectious 
persons and the overall cost of the vaccine during a fixed time period. 

  Here $S(t)$,$I(t)$,$R(t)$ respectively denote the number of susceptible 
infectious, and recovered (immune) individuals at time $t$. The model also 
consider a class that represent the number of exposed $E(t)$. 
Then the whole population $N$ is given by $N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R (t)$,
and obeys the last equation of model \eqref{eqn:epidemics_lenhart}.

The control $u(t)$ is a fraction of susceptible individual being 
vaccinated per unit of time. Since vaccination of the entire susceptible 
population is impractical, the model considers $0 \leq u(t) \leq 0.9$. 

Hence, the optimal control problem reads\em parameters in 
\Cref{tbl:epidemics_lenhart_des}.

      \dot{S}(t) &=
          bN(t) - dS(t) - cS(t)I(t) - u(t)S(t), \quad S(0) = S_0 \geq 0,   \\
      \dot{E}(t) &=
          cS(t)I(t) - (e + d)E(t), \quad E(0) = E_0 \geq 0,    \\
      \dot{I}(t) &=
          eE(t) - (g + a +d)I(t), \quad I(0) = I_0 \geq 0,     \\
      \dot{R}(t) &=
          gI(t) -dR(t) + u(t)S(t), \quad R(0) = R_0 \geq 0,    \\
      \dot{N}(t) &=
          (b - d)N(t) - aI(t), \quad N(0) = N_0 \geq 0,        \\
