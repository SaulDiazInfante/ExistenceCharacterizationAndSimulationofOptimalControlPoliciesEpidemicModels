{\bf Notation}. Each element $x$ in $\R^n$ is written as a column vector and 
$x^\top$ denotes the transpose. We write the gradient of $g:\R^n\to\R$ as a row 
vector 
    \[ g_x =(\partial g/\partial x_1,\ldots, \partial g/\partial x_n). \]
If $\lambda:\R\to\R^n$ is differentiable, the derivative is denoted 
$\dot{\lambda}=(d\lambda^1/dt,\ldots,d\lambda^n/dt)^\top$. The Jacobian matrix 
of $f=(f^1,\ldots,f^n)^\top:\R^n\to\R^n$ is   
\[f_x=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    f^1_x\\
    f^2_x\\
    \vdots \\
    f^2_x
  \end{bmatrix}
 \]
